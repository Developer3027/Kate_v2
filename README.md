This is a re-design of Kathryn's site for her run for the South Carolina Senate seat for the House in 2020. I started work on a re-design for a new look and more functionality when she either won ar ran again.

Site would still be HTML, CSS, and javascript. Bootstrap would still be worked in as before. I had an initial issue with load times for the page as that bootstrap was loading it's entire library. I was only using a small portion of Bootstrap components so I went thru the code in the browser to see what css was being used. I then split just those parts out and included in my code. This greatly reduced the load and brought initial paint up to a passing score.

On the redesign I used many of the same components used in the first draft, but took inspiration from Senator Warnock's site for this re-work. For the initial site I used Senator Warren's site for inspiration.

The site would include the following pages to start:
* About
* Issues
* Volunteer
* store

I have the site up to display the new look. No functionality has been started. This project is no longer being worked. I offer it up as a template for others to expand upon and as a reflection of my early work.

This project has good symantec HTML. The CSS naming could use some work but the code is solid and responsive. There is very little javascript written for this project. It includes OG tags / Meta Data for SEO concerns. OG tag for social linking image. CSS for the navbar and main content.

There are some design concerns but overall I feel this is a solid project.
